Container Calculations v3 - Bridge to v4

This is a temporary bridge file to maintain backward compatibility
during the v3 â†’ v4 migration. All functionality is in containers_v4.py.

This file simply re-exports everything from containers_v4 so existing
imports like `from .containers_v3 import ...` continue to work.

TODO: After full migration, remove this file and update all imports
to use containers_v4 directly.
