"""
Geographic Utilities v3 - Bridge to v4

This is a temporary bridge file to maintain backward compatibility
during the v3 â†’ v4 migration. All functionality is in geo_v4.py.

This file simply re-exports everything from geo_v4 so existing
imports like `from .geo_v3 import ...` continue to work.

TODO: After full migration, remove this file and update all imports
to use geo_v4 directly.
